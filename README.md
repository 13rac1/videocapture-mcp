# Webcam MCP

**A Model Context Protocol server for accessing and controlling webcams via OpenCV**

## Overview

Webcam MCP is a Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that provides AI assistants with the ability to access and control webcams and video sources through OpenCV. This server exposes a set of tools that allow language models to capture images, manipulate camera settings, and manage video connections.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (`opencv-python`)
- [MCP Python SDK](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/)
- [UV](https://astral.sh/uv/) (optional)

### Installation from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/13rac1/webcam-mcp.git
cd webcam-mcp
pip install -e .
```

Run the MCP server:

```bash
mcp dev webcam_mcp.py
```

## Integrating with Claude for Desktop

### macOS/Linux

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration:

```bash
# Mac
nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
# Linux
nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json 
```

Add this MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webcam-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "--with",
        "numpy",
        "--with",
        "opencv-python",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/ABSOLUTE_PATH/videocapture_mcp.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Ensure you replace `/ABSOLUTE_PATH/webcam-mcp` with your project's absolute path.

### Windows

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration:

```powershell
nano $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add this MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webcam-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "--with",
        "numpy",
        "--with",
        "opencv-python",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "C:\ABSOLUTE_PATH\videocapture-mcp\videocapture_mcp.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Ensure you replace `C:\ABSOLUTE_PATH\videocapture-mcp` with your project's absolute path.

### Using the Installation Command

Alternatively, you can use the `mcp` CLI to install the server:

```bash
mcp install videocapture_mcp.py
```

This will automatically configure Claude Desktop to use your webcam MCP server.

Once integrated, Claude will be able to access your webcam when requested. Simply ask Claude to take a photo or perform any webcam-related task.

## Features

- **Quick Image Capture**: Capture a single image from a webcam without managing connections
- **Connection Management**: Open, manage, and close camera connections
- **Video Properties**: Read and adjust camera settings like brightness, contrast, and resolution
- **Image Processing**: Basic image transformations like horizontal flipping

## Tools Reference

### `quick_capture`

Quickly open a camera, capture a single frame, and close it.

```python
quick_capture(device_index: int = 0, flip: bool = False) -> Image
```

- **device_index**: Camera index (0 is usually the default webcam)
- **flip**: Whether to horizontally flip the image
- **Returns**: The captured frame as an Image object

### `open_camera`

Open a connection to a camera device.

```python
open_camera(device_index: int = 0, name: Optional[str] = None) -> str
```

- **device_index**: Camera index (0 is usually the default webcam)
- **name**: Optional name to identify this camera connection
- **Returns**: Connection ID for the opened camera

### `capture_frame`

Capture a single frame from the specified video source.

```python
capture_frame(connection_id: str, flip: bool = False) -> Image
```

- **connection_id**: ID of the previously opened video connection
- **flip**: Whether to horizontally flip the image
- **Returns**: The captured frame as an Image object

### `get_video_properties`

Get properties of the video source.

```python
get_video_properties(connection_id: str) -> dict
```

- **connection_id**: ID of the previously opened video connection
- **Returns**: Dictionary of video properties (width, height, fps, etc.)

### `set_video_property`

Set a property of the video source.

```python
set_video_property(connection_id: str, property_name: str, value: float) -> bool
```

- **connection_id**: ID of the previously opened video connection
- **property_name**: Name of the property to set (width, height, brightness, etc.)
- **value**: Value to set
- **Returns**: True if successful, False otherwise

### `close_connection`

Close a video connection and release resources.

```python
close_connection(connection_id: str) -> bool
```

- **connection_id**: ID of the connection to close
- **Returns**: True if successful

### `list_active_connections`

List all active video connections.

```python
list_active_connections() -> list
```

- **Returns**: List of active connection IDs

## Example Usage

Here's how an AI assistant might use the Webcam MCP server:

1. **Take a quick photo**:
   ```
   I'll take a photo using your webcam.
   ```
   (The AI would call `quick_capture()` behind the scenes)

2. **Open a persistent connection**:
   ```
   I'll open a connection to your webcam so we can take multiple photos.
   ```
   (The AI would call `open_camera()` and store the connection ID)

3. **Adjust camera settings**:
   ```
   Let me increase the brightness of the webcam feed.
   ```
   (The AI would call `set_video_property()` with the appropriate parameters)

## Advanced Usage

### Resource Management

The server automatically manages camera resources, ensuring all connections are properly released when the server shuts down. For long-running applications, it's good practice to explicitly close connections when they're no longer needed.

### Multiple Cameras

If your system has multiple cameras, you can specify the device index when opening a connection:

```python
# Open the second webcam (index 1)
connection_id = open_camera(device_index=1)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera Not Found**: Ensure your webcam is properly connected and not in use by another application
- **Permission Issues**: Some systems require explicit permission to access the camera
- **OpenCV Installation**: If you encounter issues with OpenCV, refer to the [official installation guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)
